Workshop materials for ODSC 2019 Interpretability Talk

The Notebooks here are to show:
1. [Reading Skills Variable Importance](https://github.com/rajshah4/inter_workshop/blob/master/Reading%20Skills%20-%20Variable%20Importances.ipynb), which shows how split based importance is misleading compared to permutation based approach.  
2. [Lack of Fidelity-Diversity using LIME on Adult](https://github.com/rajshah4/inter_workshop/blob/master/Lack%20of%20Fidelity-Diversity%20using%20LIME%20on%20Adult.ipynb), which shows how the Adult dataset on LIME provides the same top explanation for every explanation.  
3. [Lack of Consistency using LIME on Adult](https://github.com/rajshah4/inter_workshop/blob/master/Lack%20of%20Consistency%20using%20LIME%20on%20Adult.ipynb), which shows how the same datapoint can have different explanations.  
4. [Lack of Consistency LIME Boston](https://github.com/rajshah4/inter_workshop/blob/master/Lack%20of%20Consistency%20LIME%20Boston.ipynb), which shows how the same datapoint can have different explanations.  

For more on learning about permutation, partial dependence, and explanations, take a look at the excellent [Kaggle mini course on explainability](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning-explainability) as well as the [Intepretable Machine Learning book](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/).
